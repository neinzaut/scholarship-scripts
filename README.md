# Overview
These are scripts created for my personal use, during my stay at the Scholarship Office at De La Salle University - Dasmarinas. Some key files are omitted from the repository to retain client privacy.

### file-sorter
This script utilizes Python Pandas to sort through 3000+ student records and organize them according to specific criteria. It uses an old sample file as a reference:
- A match in the **CYS** column identifies the student's College.
- A match in the **PROG** column identifies the _type of scholarship_ they are currently receiving (internally/externally funded and academic/non-academic/special scholarship).
